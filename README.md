# Emotion & Age - Predictor

This project is a facial analysis tool that predicts the age and emotion of individuals in an image. The tool uses OpenCV to detect faces in an image and DeepFace to analyze the facial attributes of the detected faces.

## Requirements
1. Python 3.6+
2. OpenCV
3. DeepFace
4. tkinter
5. PIL

## Usage
1.	Clone the repository to your local machine
2.	Install the required dependencies
3.	Run the script face_predictor.py using the command python face_predictor.py
4.	Click the "Open" button to select an image to analyze
5.	Click the "Detect Faces" button to analyze the selected image
6.	How it works
7.	The tool uses OpenCV's face detector to detect faces in an image. It then extracts each face and analyzes it using DeepFace to obtain the facial attributes. The age, gender, and emotion of each face are then displayed on the image along with a rectangle surrounding the face.
